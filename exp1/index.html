            The curriculum in computer science & engineering lays greater emphasis on design principles and development
            of system software for operating systems, Database management systems, data mining, computer graphics and
            networks. In addition to this requirement engineering, software testing, software packages and CASE tools
            which are the need of the day are integral part of the course curriculum. Miniaturizing in Computer
            technology, audio -video, and image processing, storage and retrieval, data processing, communication and
            Nano-technology etc. are going to affect the computer knowledge in the coming decades. The curriculum in the
            Department of computer science & engineering has been recently revised and state of art subjects such as
            Advance computer Networks, bio Informatics, Grid and Cluster Computing, Data Compression, Natural language
            Processing etc. have been include as electives. The revised curriculum lays emphasis on nurturing the talent
            of students for top industries across the Globe, for pursuing higher studies and R&D; work in national and
            international universities.Students are trained by covering state of art topics in the industrial training,
            minor project and open area seminars.
        </p>

        <p>
            The department has been offering M.E. degree level Programme in Computer Technology and application since
            1996. The department started M.tech in software engineering in 2009 and the M.E. in computer technology and
            applications has been renamed as M.tech in computer science and engineering. In 2011, department has started
            M.tech (software Technology) with an intake of 20. The curriculum forces on the future needs of software
            industry in the areas of design of CASE Tools, development of software testing Techniques and tools, design
            of qualities software, machine learning technology and principles ,multimedia technologies, swam
            intelligence etc. The students are doing research work and publishing numerous papers in national/
            international conferences and journals in the latest areas such as search engine, semantic web, ontology,
            information system security, requirements engineering, security engineering, software quality and metrics,
            data mining, mobile technologies, ip verification etc. as a part of their major and project.

            The source of our success is our outstanding and internationally recognized faculty members. The department
            has expanded by recruiting highly qualified faculty members at various levels. Besides teaching, the faculty
            members have been actively involved in various research and professional activities like member of editorial
            boards of leading journals. There have been numerous publications by the faculty journals/conferences
            covering latest areas of research such as requirement engineering, software quality and metrics, software
            testing, data mining and machine learning. Several technical books have been authored by the faculty Members
            of the department. The research of faculty members is supported under various research grant programmes by
            AICTE, DST, UGC and CSIR.
