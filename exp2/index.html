                Intelligence Lab</em></b>, 
                <b><em>Software Design Lab</em></b>, 
                <b><em>Software Testing Lab</em></b>. These labs are equipped with latest
            configuration PCs and are completely networked with latest software.
        </p>

        <p>
            The curriculum in computer science & engineering lays greater emphasis on design principles and development
            of system software for operating systems, Database management systems, data mining, computer graphics and
            networks. In addition to this requirement engineering, software testing, software packages and CASE tools
            which are the need of the day are integral part of the course curriculum. Miniaturizing in Computer
            technology, audio -video, and image processing, storage and retrieval, data processing, communication and
            Nano-technology etc. are going to affect the computer knowledge in the coming decades.

            The department has been offering M.E. degree level Programme in Computer Technology and application since
            1996. The department started M.tech in software engineering in 2009 and the M.E. in computer technology and
            applications has been renamed as M.tech in computer science and engineering. In 2011, department has started
            M.tech (software Technology) with an intake of 20.

            The source of our success is our outstanding and internationally recognized faculty members. The department
            has expanded by recruiting highly qualified faculty members at various levels. Besides teaching, the faculty
            members have been actively involved in various research and professional activities like member of editorial
            boards of leading journals. There have been numerous publications by the faculty journals/conferences
            covering latest areas of research such as requirement engineering, software quality and metrics, software
            testing, data mining and machine learning. Several technical books have been authored by the faculty Members
            of the department. The research of faculty members is supported under various research grant programmes by
            AICTE, DST, UGC and CSIR.
